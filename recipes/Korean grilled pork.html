    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>
        an extremely popular Korean BBQ dish. 
        Because the cooking and eating is done at the table, 
        it’s really social and a great party food. 
        It’s also pretty simple to make, 
        and because everyone pretty much helps themselves 
        it’s easy to serve, too.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li> 
            ½ lb boneless pork shoulder, or pork belly, 
            chilled or frozen for easier slicing
        </li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>3 stalks green onion, sliced into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup korean red chili paste, gochujang</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>sesame seed, to garnish</li>
        <li>rice, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Slice the pork into extremely thin slices, then transfer to a large bowl.
             This works best when the pork is super cold or partially frozen.
            </li>
        <li>
            Add in all of the ingredients besides the canola oil, then mix until the pork
             and the vegetables are evenly coated with the marinade.
            </li>
        <li>Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a pan over high heat, add pork, being sure not to crowd
             the pan, stir-fry the pork in batches until slightly crispy on the edges,
              about 3-4 minutes. If you’re using pork belly, cook for a bit longer,
               around 6-7 minutes.
            </li>
        <li>Sprinkle a bit of sesame seeds on top, then serve with rice!</li>
    </ol>
