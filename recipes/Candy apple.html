    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>
        whole apples covered in a sugar candy coating, 
        with a stick inserted as a handle. 
        These are a common treat at fall festivals in Western culture 
        in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night 
        because these festivals occur in the wake of annual apple harvests

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 c. granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 c. water</li>
        <li>1/2 c. light corn syrup</li>
        <li>16 drops red food coloring</li>
        <li>6 medium Granny Smith apples</li>
       
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Grease a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. 
            Line with parchment and grease parchment with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Insert a wooden stick into the top of each apple, 
            pushing about halfway through. Set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>In a medium heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, 
            combine sugar, 3/4 cup water, corn syrup,
             and food coloring and bring to a boil. Insert candy thermometer
              and continue to boil until temperature reaches 
              between 300° and 310°, 15 to 20 minutes. Immediately remove from heat.
            </li>
        <li>
            Wait until bubbles mostly subside (3o seconds to 1 minutes), 
            then, working quickly and carefully—coating will be extremely hot—coat 
            apples in candy mixture. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. 
        </li>
        <li>Let cool completely before serving. </li>
    </ol>
